Section B15: Powering Progress: Crafting Reliable EV Infrastructure in San Diego

Mentors: Ari Gaffen, James McCloskey, and Phi Nguyen

What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

- **The most interesting topic covered in my domain so far was the exploration of not only identifying areas that are lacking in EV chargers and
  have a low adoption rate of EVs, but how to scale up the Electric grid to sustain a growing adoption of EVs.**

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

- **A potential investigation I would like to pursue is to create a demand forecasting prediction model that forecasts the impact on the electric
  grid based on high usage periods and EV charging patterns in different regions.**

What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

- **So far the approaches taken in my Quarter 1 project have just been all about exploring the domain of EVs, clean energy transportation, the
  effects it has on the grid, understanding consumer habits, and much more. We are just starting to brainstorm major ideas on what to pursue
  further in this space to propel the adoption of EVs**

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

- **I haven't used much machine learning during this Quarter 1 portion, so I am excited to create some predictive models and even more
  exploratory data analysis on census data related to EV data.**
